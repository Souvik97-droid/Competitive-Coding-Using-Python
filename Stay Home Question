Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, everyone is advised to stay home. Some people, however, want to get out and live normally like they did.

Chef has a solution to this problem, that involves solving another problem.

To keep all the extroverts engaged at home, Chef has thought of a puzzle for them to solve.

This puzzle involves a number, N, of which the extroverts need to find the second smallest factor, F, largest digit L from the unit place, and increase all the even digits by 1 in the resultant R.

However, being incapable of doing this repeatedly for many numbers, you are now given the task to automate it. For every input N, you need to print F, L and R.

Input:
First line of input contains number of test cases, T First and only line of every test case will contain an integer N.

Output:
For each N, print a line containing 3 space-separated numbers, F L, R.

Constraints
1≤T≤1000
1≤N≤999999
Sample Input:
    1
247156
Sample Output:
4 4 357157
EXPLANATION:
The second smallest factorial for 247156 is 4. The largest digit in 247156 is 7, which is on position 4 from the unit place. 
The even digits are 2, 4 an 6, which are increased by 1, to obtain 357157
