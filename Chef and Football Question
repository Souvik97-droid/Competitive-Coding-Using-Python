Chef organized a Football tournament. N teams participated in the contest and every team was given a number 1 to N according to their arrival. The tournament rules are as follows

Each team has to play against N−1 teams
In the ith game winner team will get +4 points and the losing team will get 0 points
If a game is a draw then both teams will get +1 points

If more than one team has the Maximum point then the team who scored the maximum goals between them will be the winner.
Your task is to help the Chef find which team has won the Tournament.

Input:
The first line will contain an Integer N denoting the number of Teams participated in the Tournament.
From Second line there are N∗(N−1)/2 lines containing four Integers T1 T2 G1 G2.
T1 T2denoting the Team numbers and G1 G2 are the goals scored by the teams respectively.
Output:
You have to output a single Integer Denoting the Number of the team who won the tournament.

Constraints
1≤N≤105
1≤T1,T2≤N
0≤G1,G2≤109
Sample Input:
4
1 2 2 1
1 3 1 1
4 2 2 3
4 1 1 0
3 4 3 0
3 2 0 0
Sample Output:
3
EXPLANATION:
Team  Score  Goals
1       5       3
2       5       4
3       6       4
4       4       3
